Hi, I‚Äôm Larysha! I am embarking on my PhD in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics at Stellenbosch University in South Africa, in collaboration with the IPK Leibniz Institute in Germany. My research focuses on developing and applying deep learning models and bioinformatic analyses to large-scale OMICS datasets. Specifically, I aim to map the genome-wide transcriptional regulation in commercially significant Vitis crop cultivars.

My hope is that this research will inform future studies and industry breeding programs, helping us harness the existing natural diversity in our plant crops. This could lead to more resilient and sustainable agricultural practices for our socioeconomically important crops.

I've started this blog to track my personal learning journey in Computational Biology and record what I learn for myself as well as others - I hope you can find something valueable here.
