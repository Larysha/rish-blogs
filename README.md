### Blog Template

This is my personal blog space where I keep track of what I'm learning as I prepare for my PhD in Computational Biology. It's still a work in progress, to help me document and keep track of my own work and journey. In short, a series of analysis and personal lessons as I use machine learning approaches to make sense of "big" OMIC data. The blog is hosted at this link: https://larysha.github.io/rish-blogs/ 

If you would like to set up a blog similar to this, find all the resources for the Hugo web-page builder below (along with tutorials and templates) 💃🏻

## We ask you, humbly, to support this open source movement

Today we ask you to defend the open source independence of the Hugo Blox Builder and themes 🐧

We're an open source movement that depends on your support to stay online and thriving, but 99.9% of our creators don't give; they simply look the other way.
